# Logistic Regression Analysis of the Titanic Data Set

## This analysis was the second project of the course I2A2-ABDI.
The dataset used in this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/vsvasconcelos/i2a2/blob/main/titanic-data.csv) PS: I had to upload the raw csv file due to a parsing error while importing the file directly from the web.

The step-by-step instructions on how to analyse this dataset was explained in `section 3 - Regression Models` of the course `Python for Data Science Essential Training Part 2`.

The link to that section of the course can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-for-data-science-essential-training-part-2/logistic-regression-concepts?autoplay=true&contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A5b61ea25498e580437e51859&resume=false)

## Theory

### Logistic Regression Use Cases

* Customer Churn Prediction
* Employee Attrition Modeling
* Harzadous Event Prediction
* Purchase Propernsity vs. Ad Spend Analysis

### Assumptions of the Logistic Regression Model

* Data is free of missing values
* The predictant variable is binary (that is, it only accepts two values) or ordinal (that is, a categorical variable with ordered values)
* All predictors are independent of each other
* There are at least 50 observations per predictor variable (to ensure reliable results)
